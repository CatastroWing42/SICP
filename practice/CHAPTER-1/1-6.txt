this newly defined (new-if) do not act like (if)

e.g. (if predicate then-clause else-clause)
predicate will be evalued, then then-clause or else-clause will be evalued.
so it offers a way to break out;

but. (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
all three data will be evalued, for the explainer will evalue things before explain (new-if)
so the recursion will never break out.

well. you can replace (if) with (cond), it will work properly, but you just can not pack it in (new-if)
